# D3IE-Italy

A graphical tool based on D3.js to visualize incomes and expenses of italian families over time. 
This tool has been developed using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
Data have been analyzed and prepared using Python, with the help of Pandas and NumPy libraries.

This project was developed during the course of Scientific and large data visualization, 
which is part of the master degree in Computer Science at University of Pisa.

The whole work was done under the supervision of professors Paolo Cignoni and Daniela Giorgi, from ISTI-CNR in Pisa.
